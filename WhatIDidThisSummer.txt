What I did this summer: Duncan Klemm
I worked 40+ hrs/week at Lowe's to make as much money for the school year as I could. Additionally, I applied to internship after internship, but evidently I am unhireable.
All good though. the search process allowed me to hone in on what exactly I am looking for in terms of a job and location and stuff.

I worked at First Merchants Data Cetner this summer for an internship through Techpoint's Xtern program. I worked with a partner on rebuliding an internal app that they use at the data center to update technology and fix large bugs that were present.

Over the summer I mainly worked at Meijer. I also went to Las Vegas, which was really cool. And I went camping in Tennessee with my friends. A lot of my time was also spent playing Red Dead Redemption 2 for the first time. Very good game. I enjoyed playing it.

What I did this summer: Janardhen Jayavel
I went back to India right when the lockdown started. So, I just spent like 60 days out of 80 days back in home. The best part is eating home food that I rarely get nowadays. I got to meet some friends in the last few weeks which went well. Also, I did some courses online on udemy over Data Structures.
